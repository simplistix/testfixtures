7.2.0 (15 Sep 2023)
-------------------

- Add ``order_matters`` parameter to :class:`ShouldWarn`.

Thanks to Jan Musílek for the implementation!

7.1.0 (8 Feb 2023)
------------------

- Implement new IDE and static-analysis ways of :doc:`mocking <mocking>` including additional
  parameters to :meth:`~Replacer.replace` along with the :any:`replace_on_class`,
  :any:`replace_in_module` and :any:`replace_in_environ` context managers.

7.0.4 (5 Dec 2022)
------------------

- Remove `py.typed` file: neither `mypy` nor `testfixtures` are ready for
  this file to be present.

7.0.3 (3 Nov 2022)
------------------

- Further bugfixes around self-referential datastructures and :func:`compare`.

7.0.2 (1 Nov 2022)
------------------

- Reinstate support for self-referential data structures in :func:`compare`.
  The new implementation provides more clarity about what's going on and also ignores more
  immutable data types.

7.0.1 (1 Nov 2022)
------------------

- Remove non-functional support for self-referential data structures in :func:`compare`.
  The functionality didn't work but did cause erroneous reported equality of values in dictionaries
  that were actually not equal.

7.0.0 (6 Jul 2022)
------------------

- Refresh documentation.

- Add type annotations.

- Drop support for Python 2. The minimum supported Python version is now 3.6.

- Sybil 3 is now the minimum supported version if you use :class:`~.sybil.FileParser`.

- Rename and refactor the date and time mocks, they are now :any:`mock_date`, :any:`mock_datetime`
  and :any:`mock_time`.
  :any:`test_date<mock_date>`, :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>` and :any:`test_time <mock_time>` are still present as aliases but
  are now deprecated.

- Add :meth:`TempDirectory.as_string`, :meth:`TempDirectory.as_path` and
  ``TempDirectory.as_local``. :meth:`TempDirectory.getpath` is now deprecated.

- :class:`TempDirectory` can now be used to wrap existing directories.

- Fixed a bug where :any:`OutputCapture.captured` returned bytes instead of a string with
  ``fd=True``.

- The deprecated ``strict`` option to :class:`Comparison` has been removed, use the ``partial``
  option instead.

- The deprecated ``TempDirectory.check``, ``TempDirectory.check_dir``
  and ``TempDirectory.check_all`` methods have been removed.

Thanks to Grégoire Payen de La Garanderie for the fix.

6.14.1 (20 Apr 2020)
--------------------

- Fix bugs in comparison of :func:`~unittest.mock.call` objects where the :func:`repr` of the

6.13.0 (18 Feb 2020)
--------------------

- Allow any attributes that need to be ignored to be specified directly when calling
  :func:`~testfixtures.comparison.compare_object`. This is handy when writing
  comparers for :func:`compare`.

6.12.1 (16 Feb 2020)
--------------------

- Fix a bug that occured when using :func:`compare` to compare a string with a
  slotted object that had the same :func:`repr` as the string.

6.12.0 (6 Feb 2020)
-------------------

- Add support for ``universal_newlines``, ``text``, ``encoding`` and ``errors`` to
  :class:`popen.MockPopen`, but only for Python 3.

6.11.0 (29 Jan 2020)
--------------------

- :class:`decimal.Decimal` now has better representation when :func:`compare` displays a failed
  comparison, particularly on Python 2.

- Add support to :func:`compare` for explicitly naming objects to be compared as ``x`` and ``y``.
  This allows symmetry with the ``x_label`` and ``y_label`` parameters that are now documented.

- Restore ability for :class:`Comparison` to compare properties and methods, although these uses
  are not recommended.

Thanks to Daniel Fortunov for all of the above.

6.10.3 (22 Nov 2019)
--------------------

-------------------

- Fix edge case where string interning made dictionary comparison output much less useful.

6.10.0 (19 Jun 2019)
--------------------

- Better feedback where objects do not :func:`compare` equal but do have the same
  representation.

6.9.0 (10 Jun 2019)
-------------------

- Fix deprecation warning relating to ``getargspec``.

- Improve :doc:`mocking <mocking>` docs.

- Added ``strip_whitespace`` option to :class:`OutputCapture`.

- When ``separate`` is used with :class:`OutputCapture`, differences in ``stdout`` and ``stderr``
  are now given in the same :class:`AssertionError`.

- :class:`ShouldRaise` no longer catches exceptions that are not of the required type.

- Fixed a problem that resulted in unhelpful :func:`compare` failures when
  :func:`~unittest.mock.call` was involved and Python 3.6.7 was used.

Thanks to Łukasz Rogalski for the deprecation warning fix.

Thanks to Wim Glenn for the :class:`ShouldRaise` idea.

  Python 3.7.

Thanks to Tom Hendrikx for the fix.

-------------------

- Add :meth:`twisted.LogCapture.raise_logged_failure` debugging helper.

6.6.2 (22 Mar 2019)
-------------------

- :meth:`popen.MockPopen.set_command` is now symmetrical with
  :class:`popen.MockPopen` process instantiation in that both can be called with
  either lists or strings, in the same way as :class:`subprocess.Popen`.

6.6.1 (13 Mar 2019)
-------------------

- Fixed bugs where using :attr:`not_there` to ensure a key or attribute was not there
  but would be set by a test would result in the test attribute or key being left behind.

- Add support for comparing :func:`~functools.partial` instances and fix comparison of
  functions and other objects where ``vars()`` returns an empty :class:`dict`.

6.6.0 (22 Feb 2019)
-------------------

- Add the ability to ignore attributes of particular object types when using
  :func:`compare`.

6.5.2 (18 Feb 2019)

- Fixed :func:`compare` with :func:`~unittest.mock.call` objects for the latest Python releases.

6.4.1 (24 Dec 2018)
-------------------

- Fix bug when using :func:`unittest.mock.patch` and any of the testfixtures decorators
  at the same time and where the object being patched in was not hashable.

-------------------

- Add official support for Python 3.7.

- Drop official support for Python 3.5.

- Introduce a facade for :mod:`unittest.mock` at :mod:`testfixtures.mock`, including an

6.3.0 (4 Sep 2018)
------------------

- Allow the behaviour specified with :meth:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen.set_command` to be a
  callable meaning that mock behaviour can now be dynamic based on the command executed and whatever

- Make :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` more accurately reflect :class:`subprocess.Popen`
  on Python 3 by adding ``timeout`` parameters to :meth:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopenInstance.wait`
  and :meth:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopenInstance.communicate` along with some other smaller changes.

Thanks to Tim Davies for his work on :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

6.2.0 (14 Jun 2018)

- Better rendering of differences between :class:`bytes` when using :func:`compare`
  on Python 3.

6.1.0 (6 Jun 2018)
------------------

- Support filtering for specific warnings with :class:`ShouldWarn`.

6.0.2 (2 May 2018)
------------------

- Fix nasty bug where objects that had neither ``__dict__`` nor ``__slots__``
  would always be considered equal by :func:`compare`.

6.0.1 (17 April 2018)
---------------------

- Fix a bug when comparing equal :class:`set` instances using :func:`compare`
  when ``strict==True``.

6.0.0 (27 March 2018)
---------------------

- :func:`compare` will now handle objects that do not natively support equality or inequality
  and will treat these objects as equal if they are of the same type and have the same attributes
  as found using :func:`vars` or ``__slots__``. This is a change in behaviour which, while it could
  conceivably cause tests that are currently failing to pass, should not cause any currently
  passing tests to start failing.

- Add support for writing to the ``stdin`` of :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` instances.

- The default behaviour of :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` can now be controlled by
  providing a callable.

- :meth:`LogCapture.actual` is now part of the documented public interface.

- Add :meth:`LogCapture.check_present` to help with assertions about a sub-set of messages logged
  along with those that are logged in a non-deterministic order.

- :class:`Comparison` now supports objects with ``__slots__``.

- Added :class:`ShouldAssert` as a simpler tool for testing test helpers.

- Changed the internals of the various decorators testfixtures provides such that they can
  be used in conjunction with :func:`unittest.mock.patch` on the same test method or function.

- Changed the internals of :class:`ShouldRaise` and :class:`Comparison` to make use of
  :func:`compare` and so provide nested comparisons with better feedback. This finally
  allows :class:`ShouldRaise` to deal with Django's
  :class:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError`.

- Added handling of self-referential structures to :func:`compare` by treating all but the first
  occurence as equal. Another change needed to support Django's insane
  :class:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError`.

Thanks to Hamish Downer and Tim Davies for their work on :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

Thanks to Wim Glenn and Daniel Fortunov for their help reviewing some of the more major changes.

5.4.0 (25 January 2018)

  :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

5.3.0 (28 October 2017)
-----------------------

- Add pytest traceback hiding for :meth:`TempDirectory.compare`.

- Add warnings that :func:`log_capture`, :func:`tempdir` and
  :func:`replace` are not currently compatible with pytest's fixtures
  mechanism.

- Better support for ``stdout`` or ``stderr`` *not* being set to ``PIPE``
  when using :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

- Add support to :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` for
  using :class:`subprocess.Popen` as a context manager in Python 3.

- Add support to :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` for ``stderr=STDOUT``.

Thanks to Tim Davies for his work on :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

5.2.0 (3 September 2017)
------------------------

- :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`  and :class:`test_time <mock_time>` now accept a
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` instance during instantiation to set the initial
  value.

- :class:`test_date <mock_date>` now accepts a :class:`~datetime.date` instance during
  instantiation to set the initial value.

- Relax the restriction on adding, setting or instantiating :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>` 
  with `tzinfo` such that if the `tzinfo` matches the one configured,
  then it's okay to add.
  This means that you can now instantiate a :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`  with an existing
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` instance that has `tzinfo` set.

- :func:`testfixtures.django.compare_model` now ignores
  :class:`many to many <django.db.models.ManyToManyField>` fields rather than
  blowing up on them.

- Drop official support for Python 3.4, although things should continue to
  work.

5.1.1 (8 June 2017)

  :class:`~django.db.models.Model` instances.

5.0.0 (5 June 2017)
-------------------

- Move from `nose`__ to `pytest`__ for running tests.

  __ http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

  __ https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

- Switch from `manuel`__ to `sybil`__ for checking examples in
  documentation. This introduces a backwards incompatible change
  in that :class:`~testfixtures.sybil.FileParser` replaces the Manuel
  plugin that is no longer included.

  __ http://packages.python.org/manuel/

  __ http://sybil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

- Add a 'tick' method to :meth:`test_datetime <testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.tick>`,
  :meth:`test_date <testfixtures.datetime.MockDate.tick>` and
  :meth:`test_time <testfixtures.datetime.MockTime.tick>`,
  to advance the returned point in time, which is particularly helpful
  when ``delta`` is set to zero.

--------------------

- Fix build environment bug in ``.travis.yml`` that caused bad tarballs.

4.14.2 (15 May 2017)

-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where a :class:`LogCapture` wouldn't be cleared when used via
  :func:`log_capture` on a base class and sub class execute the same test.

Thanks to "mlabonte" for the bug report.

4.13.1 (2 November 2016)

------------------------

- Switch from ``cStringIO`` to ``StringIO`` in :class:`OutputCapture`
  to better handle unicode being written to `stdout` or `stderr`.

- Some documentation tweaks and clarifications.

- Fixed a bug which masked exceptions when using :func:`compare` with
  a broken generator.

- Fixed a bug when comparing a generator with a non-generator.

- Ensure :class:`LogCapture` cleans up global state it may effect.

- Fixed replacement of static methods using a :class:`Replacer`.

3.0.0 (5 March 2013)
--------------------

- Added compatibility with Python 3.2 and 3.3.

- Dropped compatibility with Python 2.5.

- Removed support for the following obscure uses of
  :class:`should_raise`: 

  .. invisible-code-block: python

     from testfixtures.mock import MagicMock
     should_raise = x = MagicMock()

  .. code-block:: python

    should_raise(x, IndexError)[1]
    should_raise(x, KeyError)['x']

- Dropped the `mode` parameter to :meth:`TempDirectory.read`. 

- :meth:`TempDirectory.makedir` and :meth:`TempDirectory.write` no
  longer accept a `path` parameter.
  
- :meth:`TempDirectory.read` and :meth:`TempDirectory.write` now
  accept an `encoding` parameter to control how non-byte data is
  decoded and encoded respectively.

- Added the `prefix` parameter to :func:`compare` to allow failure
  messages to be made more informative.

- Fixed a problem when using sub-second deltas with :any:`test_time <mock_time>`.

2.3.5 (13 August 2012)
----------------------

- Fixed a bug in :func:`~testfixtures.comparison.compare_dict` that
  mean the list of keys that were the same was returned in an unsorted
  order.

2.3.4 (31 January 2012)
-----------------------

- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.5

- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.7

- Development model moved to continuous integration using Jenkins.

- Introduced `Tox`__ based testing to ensure packaging and
  dependencies are as expected.

  __ http://tox.testrun.org/latest/

- 100% line and branch coverage with tests.

- Mark :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>` , :class:`test_date <mock_date>` and
  :class:`test_time <mock_time>` such that nose doesn't mistake them as tests.

2.3.3 (12 December 2011)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where when a target was replaced more than once using a
  single :class:`Replacer`, :meth:`~Replacer.restore` would not
  correctly restore the original.

2.3.2 (10 November 2011)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where attributes and keys could not be
  removed by a :class:`Replacer` as described in
  :ref:`removing_attr_and_item` if the attribute or key might not be
  there, such as where a test wants to ensure an ``os.environ``
  variable is not set.

2.3.1 (8 November 2011)
-------------------------

- Move to use `nose <http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/>`__ for running
  the testfixtures unit tests.

- Fixed a bug where :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.now` returned an instance of the
  wrong type when `tzinfo` was passed in 
  :ref:`strict mode <strict-dates-and-times>`.

2.3.0 (11 October 2011)
-------------------------

- :class:`Replacer`, :class:`TempDirectory`, :class:`LogCapture` and
  ``TestComponents`` instances will now warn if the
  process they are created in exits without them being cleaned
  up. Instances of these classes should be cleaned up at the end of
  each test and these warnings serve to point to a cause for possible
  mysterious failures elsewhere.

2.2.0 (4 October 2011)
-------------------------

- Add a :ref:`strict mode <strict-dates-and-times>` to
  :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`  and :class:`test_date <mock_date>`.
  When used, instances returned from the mocks are instances of those
  mocks. The default behaviour is now to return instances of the real
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` and :class:`~datetime.date` classes
  instead, which is usually much more useful.

2.1.0 (29 September 2011)
-------------------------

- Add a :ref:`strict mode <strict-comparison>` to
  :func:`compare`. When used, it ensures that
  the values compared are not only equal but also of the same
  type. This mode is not used by default, and the default mode
  restores the more commonly useful functionality where values of
  similar types but that aren't equal give useful feedback about
  differences.

2.0.1 (23 September 2011)
-------------------------

- add back functionality to allow comparison of generators with
  non-generators.

2.0.0 (23 September 2011)
-------------------------

- :func:`compare` now uses a registry of comparers that can be
  modified either by passing a `registry` option to :func:`compare`
  or, globally, using the :func:`~comparison.register` function.

- added a comparer for :class:`set` instances to :func:`compare`.

- added a new `show_whitespace` parameter to
  :func:`~comparison.compare_text`, the comparer used when comparing
  strings and unicodes with :func:`compare`.

- The internal queue for :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`  is now considered to
  be in local time. This has implication on the values returned from
  both :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.now` and :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.utcnow` when
  `tzinfo` is passed to the :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`  constructor.

- :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDate.set` and :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDate.add` on
  :class:`test_date <mock_date>`,
  :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`  and :class:`test_time <mock_time>` now accept instances
  of the appropriate type as an alternative to just passing in the
  parameters to create the instance.

- Refactored the monolithic ``__init__.py`` into modules for each
  type of functionality.

1.12.0 (16 August 2011)
-----------------------

- Add a :attr:`~OutputCapture.captured` property to
  :class:`OutputCapture` so that more complex assertion can be made
  about the output that has been captured.

- :class:`OutputCapture` context managers can now be temporarily
  disabled using their :meth:`~OutputCapture.disable` method.

- Logging can now be captured only when it exceeds a specified logging
  level.

- The handling of timezones has been reworked in both
  :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>` and :any:`test_time <mock_time>`. This is not backwards
  compatible but is much more useful and correct.

1.11.3 (3 August 2011)
----------------------

- Fix bugs where various :class:`test_date <mock_date>`, :class:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>` and
  :class:`test_time <mock_time>` methods didn't accept keyword parameters.

1.11.2 (28 July 2011)
---------------------

- Fix for 1.10 and 1.11 releases that didn't include non-.py files as
  a result of the move from subversion to git.

1.11.1 (28 July 2011)
---------------------

- Fix bug where :meth:`testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.now` didn't accept the `tz`
  parameter that :meth:`datetime.datetime.now` did.

1.11.0 (27 July 2011)
---------------------

- Give more useful output when comparing dicts and their subclasses.

- Turn :class:`should_raise` into a decorator form of
  :class:`ShouldRaise` rather than the rather out-moded wrapper
  function that it was.

1.10.0 (19 July 2011)
---------------------

- Remove dependency on ``zope.dottedname``.

- Implement the ability to mock out :class:`dict` and :class:`list`
  items using :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and
  :func:`~testfixtures.replace`.

- Implement the ability to remove attributes and :class:`dict`
  items using :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and
  :func:`~testfixtures.replace`.

1.9.2 (20 April 2011)
---------------------

- Fix for issue #328: :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.utcnow` of :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>`
  now returns items from the internal queue in the same way as 
  :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.now`.

1.9.1 (11 March 2011)
------------------------

- Fix bug when :class:`ShouldRaise` context managers incorrectly
  reported what exception was incorrectly raised when the incorrectly
  raised exception was a :class:`KeyError`.

1.9.0 (11 February 2011)
------------------------

- Added ``TestComponents`` for getting a sterile
  registry when testing code that uses ``zope.component``.

1.8.0 (14 January 2011)
-----------------------

- Added full Sphinx-based documentation.

- added a `Manuel <http://packages.python.org/manuel/>`__ plugin for
  reading and writing files into a :class:`TempDirectory`.

- any existing log handlers present when a :class:`LogCapture` is
  installed for a particular logger are now removed.

- fix the semantics of :class:`should_raise`, which should always
  expect an exception to be raised!

- added the :class:`ShouldRaise` context manager.

- added recursive support to :meth:`TempDirectory.listdir` and added
  the new ``TempDirectory.check_all`` method.

- added support for forward-slash separated paths to all relevant
  :class:`TempDirectory` methods.

- added :meth:`TempDirectory.getpath` method.

- allow files and directories to be ignored by a regular expression
  specification when using :class:`TempDirectory`.

- made :class:`Comparison` objects work when the attributes expected
  might be class attributes.

- re-implement :any:`test_time <mock_time>` so that it uses the correct way to
  get timezone-less time.

- added :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDateTime.set` along with `delta` and `delta_type`
  parameters to :any:`test_date <mock_date>`, :any:`test_datetime <mock_datetime>` and
  :any:`test_time <mock_time>`.

- allow the date class returned by the :meth:`~testfixtures.datetime.MockDate.today` method
  to be configured.

- added the :class:`OutputCapture` context manager.

- added the :class:`StringComparison` class.

- added options to ignore trailing whitespace and blank lines when
  comparing multi-line strings with :func:`compare`.

- fixed bugs in the handling of some exception types when using
  :class:`Comparison`, :class:`ShouldRaise` or :class:`should_raise`.

- changed :func:`wrap` to correctly set __name__, along with some
  other attributes, which should help when using the decorators with
  certain testing frameworks.

1.7.0 (20 January 2010)
-----------------------

- fixed a bug where the @replace decorator passed a classmethod
  rather than the replacment to the decorated callable when replacing
  a classmethod

- added set method to test_date, test_datetime and test_time to allow
  setting the parameters for the next instance to be returned.

- added delta and delta_type parameters to test_date,test_datetime and
  test_time to control the intervals between returned instances.


1.6.2 (23 September 2009)
-------------------------

- changed Comparison to use __eq__ and __ne__ instead of the
  deprecated __cmp__

- documented that order matters when using Comparisons with objects
  that implement __eq__ themselves, such as instances of Django
  models.

1.6.1 (06 September 2009)
-------------------------

- @replace and Replacer.replace can now replace attributes that may
  not be present, provided the `strict` parameter is passed as False.

- should_raise now catches BaseException rather than Exception so
  raising of SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt can be tested.

1.6.0 (09 May 2009)
-------------------

- added support for using TempDirectory, Replacer and LogCapture as
  context managers.

- fixed test failure in Python 2.6.

1.5.4 (11 Feb 2009)
-------------------

- fix bug where should_raise didn't complain when no exception 
  was raised but one was expected.

- clarified that the return of a should_raise call will be None
  in the event that an exception is raised but no expected 
  exception is specified.

1.5.3 (17 Dec 2008)
-------------------

- should_raise now supports methods other than __call__

1.5.2 (14 Dec 2008)

- added `makedir` and `check_dir` methods to TempDirectory and added
  support for sub directories to `read` and `write`

1.5.1 (12 Dec 2008)
-------------------

- added `path` parameter to `write` method of TempDirectory so
  that the full path of the file written can be easilly obtained

-------------------

- added handy `read` and `write` methods to TempDirectory for
  creating and reading files in the temporary directory
