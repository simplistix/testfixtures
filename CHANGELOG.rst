.. currentmodule:: testfixtures

6.8.1 (2 May 2019)
------------------

- Fix bogus import in :class:`OutputCapture`.

6.8.0 (2 May 2019)
------------------

- Allow :class:`OutputCapture` to capture the underlying file descriptors for
  :attr:`sys.stdout` and :attr:`sys.stderr`.

6.7.1 (29 Apr 2019)
-------------------

- Silence :class:`DeprecationWarning` relating to ``collections.abc`` on
  Python 3.7.

Thanks to Tom Hendrikx for the fix.

6.7.0 (11 Apr 2019)
-------------------

- Add :meth:`twisted.LogCapture.raise_logged_failure` debugging helper.

6.6.2 (22 Mar 2019)
-------------------

- :meth:`popen.MockPopen.set_command` is now symmetrical with
  :class:`popen.MockPopen` process instantiation in that both can be called with
  either lists or strings, in the same way as :class:`subprocess.Popen`.

6.6.1 (13 Mar 2019)
-------------------

- Fixed bugs where using :attr:`not_there` to ensure a key or attribute was not there
  but would be set by a test would result in the test attribute or key being left behind.

- Add support for comparing :func:`~functools.partial` instances and fix comparison of
  functions and other objects where ``vars()`` returns an empty :class:`dict`.

6.6.0 (22 Feb 2019)
-------------------

- Add the ability to ignore attributes of particular object types when using
  :func:`compare`.

6.5.2 (18 Feb 2019)
-------------------

- Fix bug when :func:`compare` was used with objects that had ``__slots__`` inherited from a
  base class but where their ``__slots__`` was an empty sequence.

6.5.1 (18 Feb 2019)
-------------------

- Fix bug when :func:`compare` was used with objects that had ``__slots__`` inherited from a
  base class.

6.5.0 (28 Jan 2019)
-------------------

- Experimental support for making assertions about events logged with Twisted's logging framework.

6.4.3 (10 Jan 2019)
-------------------

- Fix problems on Python 2 when the rolling backport of `mock`__ was not installed.

__ https://mock.readthedocs.io

6.4.2 (9 Jan 2019)
------------------

- Fixed typo in the ``executable`` parameter name for :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

- Fixed :func:`~unittest.mock.call` patching to only patch when needed.

- Fixed :func:`compare` with :func:`~unittest.mock.call` objects for the latest Python releases.

6.4.1 (24 Dec 2018)
-------------------

- Fix bug when using :func:`unittest.mock.patch` and any of the testfixtures decorators
  at the same time and where the object being patched in was not hashable.

6.4.0 (19 Dec 2018)
-------------------

- Add official support for Python 3.7.

- Drop official support for Python 3.5.

- Introduce a facade for :mod:`unittest.mock` at :mod:`testfixtures.mock`, including an
  important bug fix for :func:`~unittest.mock.call` objects.

- Better feedback when :func:`~unittest.mock.call` comparisons fail when using :func:`compare`.

- A re-working of :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` to enable it to handle multiple
  processes being active at the same time.

- Fixes to :doc:`datetime` documentation.

Thanks to Augusto Wagner Andreoli for his work on the :doc:`datetime` documentation.

6.3.0 (4 Sep 2018)
------------------

- Allow the behaviour specified with :meth:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen.set_command` to be a
  callable meaning that mock behaviour can now be dynamic based on the command executed and whatever
  was sent to ``stdin``.

- Make :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` more accurately reflect :class:`subprocess.Popen`
  on Python 3 by adding ``timeout`` parameters to :meth:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen.wait` and
  :meth:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen.communicate` along with some other smaller changes.

Thanks to Tim Davies for his work on :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

6.2.0 (14 Jun 2018)
-------------------

- Better rendering of differences between :class:`bytes` when using :func:`compare`
  on Python 3.

6.1.0 (6 Jun 2018)
------------------

- Support filtering for specific warnings with :class:`ShouldWarn`.

6.0.2 (2 May 2018)
------------------

- Fix nasty bug where objects that had neither ``__dict__`` nor ``__slots__``
  would always be considered equal by :func:`compare`.

6.0.1 (17 April 2018)
---------------------

- Fix a bug when comparing equal :class:`set` instances using :func:`compare`
  when ``strict==True``.

6.0.0 (27 March 2018)
---------------------

- :func:`compare` will now handle objects that do not natively support equality or inequality
  and will treat these objects as equal if they are of the same type and have the same attributes
  as found using :func:`vars` or ``__slots__``. This is a change in behaviour which, while it could
  conceivably cause tests that are currently failing to pass, should not cause any currently
  passing tests to start failing.

- Add support for writing to the ``stdin`` of :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` instances.

- The default behaviour of :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` can now be controlled by
  providing a callable.

- :meth:`LogCapture.actual` is now part of the documented public interface.

- Add :meth:`LogCapture.check_present` to help with assertions about a sub-set of messages logged
  along with those that are logged in a non-deterministic order.

- :class:`Comparison` now supports objects with ``__slots__``.

- Added :class:`ShouldAssert` as a simpler tool for testing test helpers.

- Changed the internals of the various decorators testfixtures provides such that they can
  be used in conjunction with :func:`unittest.mock.patch` on the same test method or function.

- Changed the internals of :class:`ShouldRaise` and :class:`Comparison` to make use of
  :func:`compare` and so provide nested comparisons with better feedback. This finally
  allows :class:`ShouldRaise` to deal with Django's
  :class:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError`.

- Added handling of self-referential structures to :func:`compare` by treating all but the first
  occurence as equal. Another change needed to support Django's insane
  :class:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError`.

Thanks to Hamish Downer and Tim Davies for their work on :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

Thanks to Wim Glenn and Daniel Fortunov for their help reviewing some of the more major changes.

5.4.0 (25 January 2018)
-----------------------

- Add explicit support for :class:`~unittest.mock.Mock` to :func:`compare`.

5.3.1 (21 November 2017)
------------------------

- Fix missing support for the `start_new_session` parameter to
  :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

5.3.0 (28 October 2017)
-----------------------

- Add pytest traceback hiding for :meth:`TempDirectory.compare`.

- Add warnings that :func:`log_capture`, :func:`tempdir` and
  :func:`replace` are not currently compatible with pytest's fixtures
  mechanism.

- Better support for ``stdout`` or ``stderr`` *not* being set to ``PIPE``
  when using :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

- Add support to :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` for
  using :class:`subprocess.Popen` as a context manager in Python 3.

- Add support to :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` for ``stderr=STDOUT``.

Thanks to Tim Davies for his work on :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

5.2.0 (3 September 2017)
------------------------

- :class:`test_datetime` and :class:`test_time` now accept a
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` instance during instantiation to set the initial
  value.

- :class:`test_date` now accepts a :class:`~datetime.date` instance during
  instantiation to set the initial value.

- Relax the restriction on adding, setting or instantiating :class:`test_datetime`
  with `tzinfo` such that if the `tzinfo` matches the one configured,
  then it's okay to add.
  This means that you can now instantiate a :class:`test_datetime` with an existing
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` instance that has `tzinfo` set.

- :func:`testfixtures.django.compare_model` now ignores
  :class:`many to many <django.db.models.ManyToManyField>` fields rather than
  blowing up on them.

- Drop official support for Python 3.4, although things should continue to
  work.

5.1.1 (8 June 2017)
-------------------

- Fix support for Django 1.9 in
  :func:`testfixtures.django.compare_model`.

5.1.0 (8 June 2017)
-------------------

- Added support for including non-edit  able fields to the
  :func:`comparer <testfixtures.django.compare_model>` used by :func:`compare`
  when comparing :doc:`django <django>`
  :class:`~django.db.models.Model` instances.

5.0.0 (5 June 2017)
-------------------

- Move from `nose`__ to `pytest`__ for running tests.

  __ http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

  __ https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

- Switch from `manuel`__ to `sybil`__ for checking examples in
  documentation. This introduces a backwards incompatible change
  in that :class:`~testfixtures.sybil.FileParser` replaces the Manuel
  plugin that is no longer included.

  __ http://packages.python.org/manuel/

  __ http://sybil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

- Add a 'tick' method to :meth:`test_datetime <tdatetime.tick>`,
  :meth:`test_date <tdate.tick>` and :meth:`test_time <ttime.tick>`,
  to advance the returned point in time, which is particularly helpful
  when ``delta`` is set to zero.

4.14.3 (15 May 2017)
--------------------

- Fix build environment bug in ``.travis.yml`` that caused bad tarballs.

4.14.2 (15 May 2017)
--------------------

  :class:`~django.db.models.Model` instances.

4.13.5 (1 March 2017)
-------------------------

- :func:`compare` now correctly compares nested empty dictionaries when using
  ``ignore_eq=True``.

4.13.4 (6 February 2017)
------------------------

- Keep the `Reproducible Builds`__ guys happy.

  __ https://reproducible-builds.org/

4.13.3 (13 December 2016)
-------------------------

- :func:`compare` now better handles equality comparison with ``ignore_eq=True``
  when either of the objects being compared cannot be hashed.

4.13.2 (16 November 2016)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where a :class:`LogCapture` wouldn't be cleared when used via
  :func:`log_capture` on a base class and sub class execute the same test.

Thanks to "mlabonte" for the bug report.

4.13.1 (2 November 2016)
------------------------

- When ``ignore_eq`` is used with :func:`compare`, fall back to comparing by
  hash if not type-specific comparer can be found.

------------------------

- Add support to :func:`compare` for ignoring broken ``__eq__`` implementations.

4.12.0 (18 October 2016)

------------------------

- Allow the attributes returned in :meth:`LogCapture.actual` rows to be
  specified.

- Allow a default to be specified for encoding in :meth:`TempDirectory.read` and
  :meth:`TempDirectory.write`.

-------------------------

- Better docs for :meth:`TempDirectory.compare`.

- Remove the need for expected paths supplied to :meth:`TempDirectory.compare`
  to be in sorted order.

- Document a good way of restoring ``stdout`` when in a debugger.

- Fix handling of trailing slashes in :meth:`TempDirectory.compare`.

Thanks to Maximilian Albert for the :meth:`TempDirectory.compare` docs.

4.10.0 (17 May 2016)
--------------------

- Fixed examples in documentation broken in 4.5.1.

- Add :class:`RangeComparison` for comparing against values that fall in a
  range.

- Add :meth:`~popen.MockPopen.set_default` to :class:`~popen.MockPopen`.

Thanks to Asaf Peleg for the :class:`RangeComparison` implementation.

4.9.1 (19 February 2016)
------------------------

- Fix for use with PyPy, broken since 4.8.0.

Thanks to Nicola Iarocci for the pull request to fix.

4.9.0 (18 February 2016)
------------------------

Thanks for Felix Yan for the metadata patch.

Thanks to Wim Glenn for the suffix patch.

4.8.0 (2 February 2016)
-----------------------

  callable. This gives more succinct and easy to read mocking code.

- Add :class:`ShouldWarn` and :class:`ShouldNotWarn` context managers.

4.7.0 (10 December 2015)
------------------------

- Add the ability to pass ``raises=False`` to :func:`compare` to just get
  the resulting message back rather than having an exception raised.

4.6.0 (3 December 2015)
------------------------

- Fix a bug that mean symlinked directories would never show up when using
  :meth:`TempDirectory.compare` and friends.

- Add the ``followlinks`` parameter to :meth:`TempDirectory.compare` to
  indicate that symlinked or hard linked directories should be recursed into
  when using ``recursive=True``.

4.5.1 (23 November 2015)
------------------------

- Switch from :class:`cStringIO` to :class:`StringIO` in :class:`OutputCapture`
  to better handle unicode being written to `stdout` or `stderr`.

Thanks to "tell-k" for the patch.

4.5.0 (13 November 2015)
------------------------

- :class:`LogCapture`, :class:`OutputCapture` and :class:`TempDirectory` now
  explicitly show what is expected versus actual when reporting differences.

Thanks to Daniel Fortunov for the pull request.

4.4.0 (1 November 2015)
-----------------------

- Add support for labelling the arguments passed to :func:`compare`.

- Allow ``expected`` and ``actual`` keyword parameters to be passed to
  :func:`compare`.

- Fix ``TypeError: unorderable types`` when :func:`compare` found multiple

- Add official support for Python 3.5.

- Drop official support for Python 2.6.

- Attempt to fix up various niggles from the move to Travis CI for doing
  releases.

4.3.1 (15 September 2015)
-------------------------

- Fix build problems introduced by moving the build process to Travis CI.

4.3.0 (15 September 2015)
-------------------------

- Add :meth:`TempDirectory.compare` with a cleaner, more explicit API that
  allows comparison of only the files in a temporary directory.

- Deprecate :meth:`TempDirectory.check`, :meth:`TempDirectory.check_dir`
  and :meth:`TempDirectory.check_all`

- Relax absolute-path rules so that if it's inside the :class:`TempDirectory`,
  it's allowed.

- Allow :class:`OutputCapture` to separately check output to ``stdout`` and
  ``stderr``.

4.2.0 (11 August 2015)
----------------------

- Add :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`, a mock helpful when testing
  code that uses :class:`subprocess.Popen`.

- :class:`ShouldRaise` now subclasses :class:`object`, so that subclasses of it
  may use :meth:`super()`.

- Drop official support for Python 3.2.

Thanks to BATS Global Markets for donating the code for
:class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

4.1.2 (30 January 2015)
-----------------------

- Clarify documentation for ``name`` parameter to :class:`LogCapture`.

- :class:`ShouldRaise` now shows different output when two exceptions have
  the same representation but still differ.

  :class:`list`.

Thanks to Daniel Fortunov for the documentation clarification.

4.1.1 (30 October 2014)
-----------------------

- Fix bug that prevented logger propagation to be controlled by the
  :class:`log_capture` decorator.

Thanks to John Kristensen for the fix.

4.1.0 (14 October 2014)
-----------------------

- Fix :func:`compare` bug when :class:`dict` instances with
  :class:`tuple` keys were not equal.

- Allow logger propagation to be controlled by :class:`LogCapture`.

- Enabled disabled loggers if a :class:`LogCapture` is attached to them.

Thanks to Daniel Fortunov for the :func:`compare` fix.

4.0.2 (10 September 2014)
-------------------------

- Fix "maximum recursion depth exceeded" when comparing a string with
  bytes that did not contain the same character.

4.0.1 (4 August 2014)
---------------------

- Fix bugs when string compared equal and options to :func:`compare`
  were used.

- Fix bug when strictly comparing two nested structures containing
  identical objects.

4.0.0 (22 July 2014)
--------------------

- Moved from buildout to virtualenv for development.

- The ``identity`` singleton is no longer needed and has been
  removed.

- :func:`compare` will now work recursively on data structures for
  which it has registered comparers, giving more detailed feedback on
  nested data structures. Strict comparison will also be applied
  recursively.

- Re-work the interfaces for using custom comparers with
  :func:`compare`.

- Better feedback when comparing :func:`collections.namedtuple`
  instances.

- Official support for Python 3.4.

Thanks to Yevgen Kovalienia for the typo fix in :doc:`datetime`.

3.1.0 (25 May 2014)
-------------------

- Added :class:`RoundComparison` helper for comparing numerics to a
  specific precision.

- Added ``unless`` parameter to :class:`ShouldRaise` to cover
  some very specific edge cases.

- Fix missing imports that showed up :class:`TempDirectory` had to do
  the "convoluted folder delete" dance on Windows.

Thanks to Jon Thompson for the :class:`RoundComparison` implementation.

Thanks to Matthias Lehmann for the import error reports.

3.0.2 (7 April 2014)
--------------------

- Document :attr:`ShouldRaise.raised` and make it part of the official
  API. 

- Fix rare failures when cleaning up :class:`TempDirectory` instances
  on Windows.

3.0.1 (10 June 2013)
--------------------

- Some documentation tweaks and clarifications.

- Fixed a bug which masked exceptions when using :func:`compare` with
  a broken generator.

- Fixed a bug when comparing a generator with a non-generator.

- Ensure :class:`LogCapture` cleans up global state it may effect.

- Fixed replacement of static methods using a :class:`Replacer`.

3.0.0 (5 March 2013)
--------------------

- Added compatibility with Python 3.2 and 3.3.

- Dropped compatibility with Python 2.5.

- Removed support for the following obscure uses of
  :class:`should_raise`: 

  .. invisible-code-block: python

     from testfixtures.mock import MagicMock
     should_raise = x = MagicMock()

  .. code-block:: python

    should_raise(x, IndexError)[1]
    should_raise(x, KeyError)['x']

- Dropped the `mode` parameter to :meth:`TempDirectory.read`. 

- :meth:`TempDirectory.makedir` and :meth:`TempDirectory.write` no
  longer accept a `path` parameter.
  
- :meth:`TempDirectory.read` and :meth:`TempDirectory.write` now
  accept an `encoding` parameter to control how non-byte data is
  decoded and encoded respectively.

- Added the `prefix` parameter to :func:`compare` to allow failure
  messages to be made more informative.

- Fixed a problem when using sub-second deltas with :func:`test_time`.

2.3.5 (13 August 2012)
----------------------

- Fixed a bug in :func:`~testfixtures.comparison.compare_dict` that
  mean the list of keys that were the same was returned in an unsorted
  order.

2.3.4 (31 January 2012)
-----------------------

- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.5

- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.7

- Development model moved to continuous integration using Jenkins.

- Introduced `Tox`__ based testing to ensure packaging and
  dependencies are as expected.

  __ http://tox.testrun.org/latest/

- 100% line and branch coverage with tests.

- Mark :class:`test_datetime`, :class:`test_date` and
  :class:`test_time` such that nose doesn't mistake them as tests.

2.3.3 (12 December 2011)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where when a target was replaced more than once using a
  single :class:`Replacer`, :meth:`~Replacer.restore` would not
  correctly restore the original.

2.3.2 (10 November 2011)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where attributes and keys could not be
  removed by a :class:`Replacer` as described in
  :ref:`removing_attr_and_item` if the attribute or key might not be
  there, such as where a test wants to ensure an ``os.environ``
  variable is not set.

2.3.1 (8 November 2011)
-------------------------

- Move to use `nose <http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/>`__ for running
  the TestFixtures unit tests.

- Fixed a bug where :meth:`tdatetime.now` returned an instance of the
  wrong type when `tzinfo` was passed in 
  :ref:`strict mode <strict-dates-and-times>`.

2.3.0 (11 October 2011)
-------------------------

- :class:`Replacer`, :class:`TempDirectory`, :class:`LogCapture` and
  :class:`~components.TestComponents` instances will now warn if the
  process they are created in exits without them being cleaned
  up. Instances of these classes should be cleaned up at the end of
  each test and these warnings serve to point to a cause for possible
  mysterious failures elsewhere.

2.2.0 (4 October 2011)
-------------------------

- Add a :ref:`strict mode <strict-dates-and-times>` to
  :class:`test_datetime` and :class:`test_date`. 
  When used, instances returned from the mocks are instances of those
  mocks. The default behaviour is now to return instances of the real
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` and :class:`~datetime.date` classes
  instead, which is usually much more useful.

2.1.0 (29 September 2011)
-------------------------

- Add a :ref:`strict mode <strict-comparison>` to
  :func:`compare`. When used, it ensures that
  the values compared are not only equal but also of the same
  type. This mode is not used by default, and the default mode
  restores the more commonly useful functionality where values of
  similar types but that aren't equal give useful feedback about
  differences.

2.0.1 (23 September 2011)
-------------------------

- add back functionality to allow comparison of generators with
  non-generators.

2.0.0 (23 September 2011)
-------------------------

- :func:`compare` now uses a registry of comparers that can be
  modified either by passing a `registry` option to :func:`compare`
  or, globally, using the :func:`~comparison.register` function.

- added a comparer for :class:`set` instances to :func:`compare`.

- added a new `show_whitespace` parameter to
  :func:`~comparison.compare_text`, the comparer used when comparing
  strings and unicodes with :func:`compare`.

- The internal queue for :class:`test_datetime` is now considered to
  be in local time. This has implication on the values returned from
  both :meth:`~tdatetime.now` and :meth:`~tdatetime.utcnow` when
  `tzinfo` is passed to the :class:`test_datetime` constructor.

- :meth:`set` and :meth:`add` on :class:`test_date`,
  :class:`test_datetime` and :class:`test_time` now accept instances
  of the appropriate type as an alternative to just passing in the
  parameters to create the instance.

- Refactored the monolithic ``__init__.py`` into modules for each
  type of functionality.

1.12.0 (16 August 2011)
-----------------------

- Add a :attr:`~OutputCapture.captured` property to
  :class:`OutputCapture` so that more complex assertion can be made
  about the output that has been captured.

- :class:`OutputCapture` context managers can now be temporarily
  disabled using their :meth:`~OutputCapture.disable` method.

- Logging can now be captured only when it exceeds a specified logging
  level.

- The handling of timezones has been reworked in both
  :func:`test_datetime` and :func:`test_time`. This is not backwards
  compatible but is much more useful and correct.

1.11.3 (3 August 2011)
----------------------

- Fix bugs where various :meth:`test_date`, :meth:`test_datetime` and
  :meth:`test_time` methods didn't accept keyword parameters.

1.11.2 (28 July 2011)
---------------------

- Fix for 1.10 and 1.11 releases that didn't include non-.py files as
  a result of the move from subversion to git.

1.11.1 (28 July 2011)
---------------------

- Fix bug where :meth:`tdatetime.now` didn't accept the `tz`
  parameter that :meth:`datetime.datetime.now` did.

1.11.0 (27 July 2011)
---------------------

- Give more useful output when comparing dicts and their subclasses.

- Turn :class:`should_raise` into a decorator form of
  :class:`ShouldRaise` rather than the rather out-moded wrapper
  function that it was.

1.10.0 (19 July 2011)
---------------------

- Remove dependency on :mod:`zope.dottedname`.

- Implement the ability to mock out :class:`dict` and :class:`list`
  items using :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and
  :func:`~testfixtures.replace`.

- Implement the ability to remove attributes and :class:`dict`
  items using :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and
  :func:`~testfixtures.replace`.

1.9.2 (20 April 2011)
---------------------

- Fix for issue #328: :meth:`~tdatetime.utcnow` of :func:`test_datetime`
  now returns items from the internal queue in the same way as 
  :meth:`~tdatetime.now`.

1.9.1 (11 March 2011)
------------------------

- Fix bug when :class:`ShouldRaise` context managers incorrectly
  reported what exception was incorrectly raised when the incorrectly
  raised exception was a :class:`KeyError`.

1.9.0 (11 February 2011)
------------------------

- Added :class:`~components.TestComponents` for getting a sterile
  registry when testing code that uses :mod:`zope.component`.

1.8.0 (14 January 2011)
-----------------------

- Added full Sphinx-based documentation.

- added a `Manuel <http://packages.python.org/manuel/>`__ plugin for
  reading and writing files into a :class:`TempDirectory`.

- any existing log handlers present when a :class:`LogCapture` is
  installed for a particular logger are now removed.

- fix the semantics of :class:`should_raise`, which should always
  expect an exception to be raised!
