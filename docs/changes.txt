4.3.0 (15 September 2015)
-------------------------

- Add :meth:`TempDirectory.compare` with a cleaner, more explicit API that
  allows comparison of only the files in a temporary directory.

- Deprecate :meth:`TempDirectory.check`, :meth:`TempDirectory.check_dir`
  and :meth:`TempDirectory.check_all`

- Relax absolute-path rules so that if it's inside the :class:`TempDirectory`,
  it's allowed.

- Allow :class:`OutputCapture` to separately check output to ``stdout`` and
  ``stderr``.

4.2.0 (11 August 2015)
----------------------

- Add :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`, a mock helpful when testing
  code that uses :class:`subprocess.Popen`.

- :class:`ShouldRaise` now subclasses :class:`object`, so that subclasses of it
  may use :meth:`super()`.

- Drop official support for Python 3.2.

Thanks to BATS Global Markets for donating the code for
:class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`.

4.1.2 (30 January 2015)
-----------------------

- Clarify documentation for ``name`` parameter to :class:`LogCapture`.

- :class:`ShouldRaise` now shows different output when two exceptions have

- Enabled disabled loggers if a :class:`LogCapture` is attached to them.

Thanks to Daniel Fortunov for the :func:`compare` fix.

4.0.2 (10 September 2014)
-------------------------

- Fix "maximum recursion depth exceeded" when comparing a string with
  bytes that did not contain the same character.

4.0.1 (4 August 2014)
---------------------

- Fix bugs when string compared equal and options to :func:`compare`
  were used.

- Fix bug when strictly comparing two nested structures containing
  identical objects.

4.0.0 (22 July 2014)
--------------------

- Moved from buildout to virtualenv for development.

- The ``identity`` singleton is no longer needed and has been
  removed.

- :func:`compare` will now work recursively on data structures for
  which it has registered comparers, giving more detailed feedback on
  nested data structures. Strict comparison will also be applied
  recursively.

- Re-work the interfaces for using custom comparers with
  :func:`compare`.

- Better feedback when comparing :func:`collections.namedtuple`
  instances.

- Official support for Python 3.4.

Thanks to Yevgen Kovalienia for the typo fix in :doc:`datetime`.

-------------------

- Added :class:`RoundComparison` helper for comparing numerics to a
  specific precision.

- Added ``unless`` parameter to :class:`ShouldRaise` to cover
  some very specific edge cases.

- Fix missing imports that showed up :class:`TempDirectory` had to do
  the "convoluted folder delete" dance on Windows.

Thanks to Jon Thompson for the :class:`RoundComparison` implementation.

Thanks to Matthias Lehmann for the import error reports.

3.0.2 (7 April 2014)
--------------------

- Document :attr:`ShouldRaise.raised` and make it part of the official
  API. 

- Fix rare failures when cleaning up :class:`TempDirectory` instances
  on Windows.

--------------------

- Some documentation tweaks and clarifications.

- Fixed a bug which masked exceptions when using :func:`compare` with
  a broken generator.

- Fixed a bug when comparing a generator with a non-generator.

- Ensure :class:`LogCapture` cleans up global state it may effect.

- Fixed replacement of static methods using a :class:`Replacer`.

3.0.0 (5 March 2013)
--------------------

- Added compatibility with Python 3.2 and 3.3.

- Dropped compatibility with Python 2.5.

- Removed support for the following obscure uses of
  :class:`should_raise`: 

  .. code-block:: python

    should_raise(x, IndexError)[1]
    should_raise(x, KeyError)['x']

- Dropped the `mode` parameter to :meth:`TempDirectory.read`. 

- :meth:`TempDirectory.makedir` and :meth:`TempDirectory.write` no
  longer accept a `path` parameter.
  
- :meth:`TempDirectory.read` and :meth:`TempDirectory.write` now
  accept an `encoding` parameter to control how non-byte data is
  decoded and encoded respectively.

- Added the `prefix` parameter to :func:`compare` to allow failure
  messages to be made more informative.

- Fixed a problem when using sub-second deltas with :func:`test_time`.

2.3.5 (13 August 2012)
----------------------

- Fixed a bug in :func:`~testfixtures.comparison.compare_dict` that
  mean the list of keys that were the same was returned in an unsorted
  order.

2.3.4 (31 January 2012)
-----------------------

- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.5

- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.7

- Development model moved to continuous integration using Jenkins.

- Introduced `Tox`__ based testing to ensure packaging and
  dependencies are as expected.

  __ http://tox.testrun.org/latest/

- 100% line and branch coverage with tests.

- Mark :class:`test_datetime`, :class:`test_date` and
  :class:`test_time` such that nose doesn't mistake them as tests.

2.3.3 (12 December 2011)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where when a target was replaced more than once using a
  single :class:`Replacer`, :meth:`~Replacer.restore` would not
  correctly restore the original.

2.3.2 (10 November 2011)
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where attributes and keys could not be
  removed by a :class:`Replacer` as described in
  :ref:`removing_attr_and_item` if the attribute or key might not be
  there, such as where a test wants to ensure an ``os.environ``
  variable is not set.

2.3.1 (8 November 2011)
-------------------------

- Move to use `nose <http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/>`__ for running
  the TestFixtures unit tests.

- Fixed a bug where :meth:`tdatetime.now` returned an instance of the
  wrong type when `tzinfo` was passed in 
  :ref:`strict mode <strict-dates-and-times>`.

2.3.0 (11 October 2011)
-------------------------

- :class:`Replacer`, :class:`TempDirectory`, :class:`LogCapture` and
  :class:`~components.TestComponents` instances will now warn if the
  process they are created in exits without them being cleaned
  up. Instances of these classes should be cleaned up at the end of
  each test and these warnings serve to point to a cause for possible
  mysterious failures elsewhere.

2.2.0 (4 October 2011)
-------------------------

- Add a :ref:`strict mode <strict-dates-and-times>` to
  :class:`test_datetime` and :class:`test_date`. 
  When used, instances returned from the mocks are instances of those
  mocks. The default behaviour is now to return instances of the real
  :class:`~datetime.datetime` and :class:`~datetime.date` classes
  instead, which is usually much more useful.

2.1.0 (29 September 2011)
-------------------------

- Add a :ref:`strict mode <strict-comparison>` to
  :func:`compare`. When used, it ensures that
  the values compared are not only equal but also of the same
  type. This mode is not used by default, and the default mode
  restores the more commonly useful functionality where values of
  similar types but that aren't equal give useful feedback about
  differences.

2.0.1 (23 September 2011)
-------------------------

- add back functionality to allow comparison of generators with
  non-generators.

2.0.0 (23 September 2011)
-------------------------

- :func:`compare` now uses a registry of comparers that can be
  modified either by passing a `registry` option to :func:`compare`
  or, globally, using the :func:`~comparison.register` function.

- added a comparer for :class:`set` instances to :func:`compare`.

- added a new `show_whitespace` parameter to
  :func:`~comparison.compare_text`, the comparer used when comparing
  strings and unicodes with :func:`compare`.

- The internal queue for :class:`test_datetime` is now considered to
  be in local time. This has implication on the values returned from
  both :meth:`~tdatetime.now` and :meth:`~tdatetime.utcnow` when
  `tzinfo` is passed to the :class:`test_datetime` constructor.

- :meth:`set` and :meth:`add` on :class:`test_date`,
  :class:`test_datetime` and :class:`test_time` now accept instances
  of the appropriate type as an alternative to just passing in the
  parameters to create the instance.

- Refactored the monolithic ``__init__.py`` into modules for each
  type of functionality.

1.12.0 (16 August 2011)
-----------------------

- Add a :attr:`~OutputCapture.captured` property to
  :class:`OutputCapture` so that more complex assertion can be made
  about the output that has been captured.

- :class:`OutputCapture` context managers can now be temporarily
  disabled using their :meth:`~OutputCapture.disable` method.

- Logging can now be captured only when it exceeds a specified logging
  level.

- The handling of timezones has been reworked in both
  :func:`test_datetime` and :func:`test_time`. This is not backwards
  compatible but is much more useful and correct.

1.11.3 (3 August 2011)
----------------------

- Fix bugs where various :meth:`test_date`, :meth:`test_datetime` and
  :meth:`test_time` methods didn't accept keyword parameters.

1.11.2 (28 July 2011)
---------------------

- Fix for 1.10 and 1.11 releases that didn't include non-.py files as
  a result of the move from subversion to git.

1.11.1 (28 July 2011)
---------------------

- Fix bug where :meth:`tdatetime.now` didn't accept the `tz`
  parameter that :meth:`datetime.datetime.now` did.

1.11.0 (27 July 2011)
---------------------

- Give more useful output when comparing dicts and their subclasses.

- Turn :class:`should_raise` into a decorator form of
  :class:`ShouldRaise` rather than the rather out-moded wrapper
  function that it was.

1.10.0 (19 July 2011)
---------------------

- Remove dependency on :mod:`zope.dottedname`.

- Implement the ability to mock out :class:`dict` and :class:`list`
  items using :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and
  :func:`~testfixtures.replace`.

- Implement the ability to remove attributes and :class:`dict`
  items using :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and
  :func:`~testfixtures.replace`.

1.9.2 (20 April 2011)
---------------------

- Fix for issue #328: :meth:`~tdatetime.utcnow` of :func:`test_datetime`
  now returns items from the internal queue in the same way as 
  :meth:`~tdatetime.now`.

1.9.1 (11 March 2011)
------------------------

- Fix bug when :class:`ShouldRaise` context managers incorrectly
  reported what exception was incorrectly raised when the incorrectly
  raised exception was a :class:`KeyError`.

1.9.0 (11 February 2011)
------------------------

- Added :class:`~components.TestComponents` for getting a sterile
  registry when testing code that uses :mod:`zope.component`.

1.8.0 (14 January 2011)
-----------------------

- Added full Sphinx-based documentation.

- added a `Manuel <http://packages.python.org/manuel/>`__ plugin for
  reading and writing files into a :class:`TempDirectory`.

- any existing log handlers present when a :class:`LogCapture` is
  installed for a particular logger are now removed.

- fix the semantics of :class:`should_raise`, which should always
  expect an exception to be raised!

- added the :class:`ShouldRaise` context manager.

- added recursive support to :meth:`TempDirectory.listdir` and added
  the new :meth:`TempDirectory.check_all` method.

- added support for forward-slash separated paths to all relevant
  :class:`TempDirectory` methods.

- added :meth:`TempDirectory.getpath` method.

- allow files and directories to be ignored by a regular expression
  specification when using :class:`TempDirectory`.

- made :class:`Comparison` objects work when the attributes expected
  might be class attributes.

- re-implement :func:`test_time` so that it uses the correct way to
  get timezone-less time.

- added :meth:`~tdatetime.set` along with `delta` and `delta_type`
  parameters to :func:`test_date`, :func:`test_datetime` and
  :func:`test_time`.

- allow the date class returned by the :meth:`tdatetime.date` method
  to be configured.

- added the :class:`OutputCapture` context manager.

- added the :class:`StringComparison` class.

- added options to ignore trailing whitespace and blank lines when
  comparing multi-line strings with :func:`compare`.

- fixed bugs in the handling of some exception types when using
  :class:`Comparison`, :class:`ShouldRaise` or :class:`should_raise`.

- changed :func:`wrap` to correctly set __name__, along with some
  other attributes, which should help when using the decorators with
  certain testing frameworks.

1.7.0 (20 January 2010)
-----------------------

- fixed a bug where the @replace decorator passed a classmethod
  rather than the replacment to the decorated callable when replacing
  a classmethod

- added set method to test_date, test_datetime and test_time to allow
  setting the parameters for the next instance to be returned.

- added delta and delta_type parameters to test_date,test_datetime and
  test_time to control the intervals between returned instances.


1.6.2 (23 September 2009)
-------------------------

- changed Comparison to use __eq__ and __ne__ instead of the
  deprecated __cmp__

- documented that order matters when using Comparisons with objects
  that implement __eq__ themselves, such as instances of Django
  models.

1.6.1 (06 September 2009)
-------------------------

- @replace and Replacer.replace can now replace attributes that may
  not be present, provided the `strict` parameter is passed as False.

- should_raise now catches BaseException rather than Exception so
  raising of SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt can be tested.

1.6.0 (09 May 2009)
-------------------

- added support for using TempDirectory, Replacer and LogCapture as
  context managers.

- fixed test failure in Python 2.6.

1.5.4 (11 Feb 2009)
-------------------

- fix bug where should_raise didn't complain when no exception 
  was raised but one was expected.

  in the event that an exception is raised but no expected 
  exception is specified.

-------------------

- should_raise now supports methods other than __call__

1.5.2 (14 Dec 2008)
