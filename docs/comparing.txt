Comparing objects and sequences
===============================

.. currentmodule:: testfixtures

Python's :mod:`unittest` package often fails to give very useful
feedback when comparing long sequences or chunks of text. It also has
trouble dealing with objects that don't natively support
comparison. The functions and classes described here alleviate these
problems.

The compare function
--------------------

This function can be used as a replacement for
:meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual`. It raises an
``AssertionError`` when its parameters are not equal, which will be
reported as a test failure:

>>> from testfixtures import compare
>>> compare(1, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 1 != 2

The real strengths of this function come when comparing more complex
data types. A number of common python data types will give more
detailed output when a comparison fails as described below:

sets
~~~~
 
Comparing sets that aren't the same will attempt to
highlight where the differences lie:

>>> compare(set([1, 2]), set([2, 3]))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: set not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
in first but not second:
[1]
<BLANKLINE>
in second but not first:
[3]
<BLANKLINE>
<BLANKLINE>

dicts
~~~~~

Comparing dictionaries that aren't the same will attempt to
highlight where the differences lie:

>>> compare(dict(x=1, y=2, a=4),dict(x=1, z=3, a=5))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: dict not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
same:
['x']
<BLANKLINE>
in first but not second:
'y': 2
<BLANKLINE>
in second but not first:
'z': 3
<BLANKLINE>
values differ:
'a': 4 != 5
<BLANKLINE>
<BLANKLINE>

lists and tuples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparing lists or tuples that aren't the same will attempt to highlight
where the differences lie:

>>> compare([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4])
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: Sequence not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
same:
[1, 2]
<BLANKLINE>
first:
[3]
<BLANKLINE>
second:
[4]

generators
~~~~~~~~~~

When two generators are compared, they are both first unwound into
tuples and those tuples are then compared.

The :ref:`generator <generator>` helper is useful for creating a
generator to represent the expected results:

>>> from testfixtures import generator
>>> def my_gen(t):
...     i = 0
...     while i<t:
...         i += 1
...         yield i
>>> compare(generator(1, 2, 3), my_gen(2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: Sequence not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
same:
(1, 2)
<BLANKLINE>
first:
(3,)
<BLANKLINE>
second:
()

.. _comparison-generators:

If only the first item passed to :func:`compare` is a generator, the
second item will be cast into a generator. This is very useful for
making assertions about return values that are iterable without
actually being generators and without having to manually cast the
value to something comparable, such as a tuple:

>>> compare(generator(1, 2, 3), xrange(1,4))
<identity>

.. warning::

  If you wish to assert that a function returns a generator, say, for
  performance reasons, then you should use 
  :ref:`strict comparison <strict-comparison>`.
  
strings and unicodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparison of strings can be tricky, particularly when those strings
contain multiple lines; spotting the differences between the expected
and actual values can be hard.

To help with this, long strings give a more helpful representation
when comparison fails:

>>> compare("1234567891011", "1234567789")
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
'1234567891011'
!=
'1234567789'

Likewise, multi-line strings give unified diffs when their comparison
fails:

>>> compare("""
...         This is line 1
...         This is line 2
...         This is line 3
...         """,
...         """
...         This is line 1
...         This is another line
...         This is line 3
...         """)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
<BLANKLINE>
         This is line 1
-        This is line 2
+        This is another line
         This is line 3
<BLANKLINE>

Such comparisons can still be confusing as white space is taken into
account. If you need to care about whitespace characters, you can make
spotting the differences easier as follows:

>>> compare("\tline 1\r\nline 2"," line1 \nline 2", show_whitespace=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
-'\tline 1\r\n'
+' line1 \n'
 'line 2'

However, you may not care about some of the whitespace involved. To
help with this, :func:`compare` has two options that can be set to
ignore certain types of whitespace.

If you wish to compare two strings that contain blank lines or lines
containing only whitespace characters, but where you only care about
the content, you can use the following:

.. code-block:: python

  compare('line1\nline2', 'line1\n \nline2\n\n',
          blanklines=False)

If you wish to compare two strings made up of lines that may have
trailing whitespace that you don't care about, you can do so with the
following: 

.. code-block:: python

  compare('line1\nline2', 'line1 \t\nline2   \n',
          trailing_whitespace=False)

providing your own comparers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using :meth:`compare` frequently for your own complex objects,
it can be beneficial to give more descriptive output when two objects
don't compare as equal.

.. note:: 

    If you are reading this section as a result of needing to test
    objects that don't natively support comparison, or as a result of
    needing to infrequently compare your own subclasses of python
    basic types, take a look at :ref:`comparison-objects` as this may
    well be an easier solution.

Providing a comparer can be particularly useful when the objects
involved are instances of subclasses of python basic data types. 
For example, suppose you're using a :func:`~collections.namedtuple`:

.. invisible-code-block: python

  # python2.5 doesn't have namedtuple
  try:
      from collections import namedtuple
  except ImportError:
      def namedtuple(name, *args):
          class TheRow(tuple): 
               def __new__(cls, *args):
                   return super(TheRow, cls).__new__(cls, args)
               def __repr__(self):
                   name = self.__class__.__name__
                   if len(self)==3:
                       return name+"(x=%s, y=%s, z=%s)" % self
                   elif len(self)==1:
                       return name+"(x=%s)" % self
                   else:
                       return '<compat error>'
          TheRow.__name__ = name
          TheRow.__module__ = '__main__'
          return TheRow

.. code-block:: python

 DataRow = namedtuple('DataRow', ('x', 'y', 'z'))

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from testfixtures.comparison import _registry
  from testfixtures import Replacer
  r = Replacer()
  r.replace('testfixtures.comparison._registry', {})

If this tuple contained many elements, you may want to use the
:func:`~testfixtures.comparison.compare_sequence` function to show
differences when two of these objects are not equal. This can be done
as follows:

>>> from testfixtures.comparison import register, compare_sequence
>>> register(DataRow, compare_sequence)
>>> compare(DataRow(1, 2, 3), DataRow(1, 2, 4))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: Sequence not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
same:
(1, 2)
<BLANKLINE>
first:
(3,)
<BLANKLINE>
second:
(4,)

.. invisible-code-block: python

  import testfixtures.comparison
  assert testfixtures.comparison._registry == {DataRow: compare_sequence}

A full list of the available comparers included can be found below the
API documentation for :func:`compare`. If you wish to provide your own
comparer, it should be a function that takes two positional arguments,
the two objects to be compare, and, if necessary, keyword arguments to
configure the comparison, which will be passed through from the
:func:`compare` call. Comparers may do some processing and then decide
that, for the purposes of the test, the two objects are equal. In this
case, the comparer should return
:data:`~testfixtures.identity` to indicate that no exception
should be raised.

For example, suppose you want to optionally compare only two of the
three elements of the :func:`~collections.namedtuple` above; this
could be implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from testfixtures import identity

  def compare_DataRow(x, y, all=True):
      cx, cy = x[:2], y[:2]
      if not all and (cx==cy):
          return identity
      return '%r != %r' % (x, y)

To use this, you'd do the following:

>>> from testfixtures.comparison import register
>>> register(DataRow, compare_DataRow)
>>> compare(DataRow(1, 2, 3), DataRow(1, 2, 4))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: DataRow(x=1, y=2, z=3) != DataRow(x=1, y=2, z=4)
>>> compare(DataRow(1, 2, 3), DataRow(1, 2, 4), all=False)
<identity>

.. invisible-code-block: python

  assert testfixtures.comparison._registry == {DataRow: compare_DataRow}
  r.restore()

  # set up for the next test
  r = Replacer()
  r.replace('testfixtures.comparison._registry', {})

Now, it may be that you only want to use a comparer or set of
comparers for a particular test. If that's the case, you can pass in a
registry to the compare function, which will be used instead of the
global registry:

>>> compare(DataRow(1, 2, 3), DataRow(1, 2, 4),
...         registry={DataRow:compare_DataRow})
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: DataRow(x=1, y=2, z=3) != DataRow(x=1, y=2, z=4)


.. invisible-code-block: python

  import testfixtures.comparison
  assert testfixtures.comparison._registry == {}
  r.restore()

.. _strict-comparison:

Strict comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If is it important that the two values being compared are of exactly
the same type, rather than just being equal as far as python is
concerned, then the scrict mode of :func:`compare` should be used.

For example, these two instances will normally appear to be equal
provided the elements within them are the same:

>>> TypeA = namedtuple('A', 'x')
>>> TypeB = namedtuple('B', 'x')
>>> compare(TypeA(1), TypeB(1))
<identity>

If this type difference is important, then the `strict` parameter
should be used:

>>> compare(TypeA(1), TypeB(1), strict=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: A(x=1) (<class '__main__.A'>)!= B(x=1) (<class '__main__.B'>)

.. _comparison-objects:

Comparison objects
------------------

Another common problem with the checking in tests is that not all
objects support comparison and nor should they need to. For this
reason, TextFixtures provides the :class:`~testfixtures.Comparison`
class.

This class lets you instantiate placeholders that can be used to
compare expected results with actual results where objects in the
actual results do not support useful comparison.  

Comparisons will appear to be equal to any object they are compared
with that matches their specification. For example, take the following
class: 

.. code-block:: python

  class SomeClass:

      def __init__(self,x,y):
         self.x,self.y = x,y

Normal comparison doesn't work, which makes testing tricky:

>>> SomeClass(1,2)==SomeClass(1,2)
False

Here's how this comparison can be done:

>>> from testfixtures import Comparison as C
>>> C(SomeClass,x=1,y=2)==SomeClass(1,2)
True

Perhaps even more importantly, when a comparison fails, its
representation changes to give information about what went wrong. The
common idiom for using comparisons is in conjuction with
:meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual` or
:meth:`~testfixtures.compare`: 

>>> compare(C(SomeClass,x=2),SomeClass(1,2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
  <C(failed):__builtin__.SomeClass>
  x:2 != 1
  y:2 not in Comparison
  </C> != <__builtin__.SomeClass instance at ...>

The key is that the comparison object actually stores information
about what it was last compared with. The following example shows this
more clearly: 

>>> c = C(SomeClass,x=2)
>>> print repr(c)
<BLANKLINE>
  <C:__builtin__.SomeClass>
  x:2
  </C>
>>> c == SomeClass(1,2)
False
>>> print repr(c)
<BLANKLINE>
  <C(failed):__builtin__.SomeClass>
  x:2 != 1
  y:2 not in Comparison
  </C>


Types of comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways a comparison can be set up depending on what
you want to check.

If you only care about the class of an object, you can set up the
comparison with only the class:

>>> C(SomeClass)==SomeClass(1,2)
True

This can also be achieved by specifying the type of the object as a
dotted name:

>>> import sys
>>> C('types.ModuleType')==sys
True

Alternatively, if you happen to have a non-comparable object already
around, comparison can be done with it:

>>> C(SomeClass(1,2))==SomeClass(1,2)
True

If you only care about certain attributes, this can also easily be
achieved with the `strict` parameter: 

>>> C(SomeClass,x=1,strict=False)==SomeClass(1,2)
True

The above can be problematic if you want to compare an object with
attibutes that share names with parameters to the :class:`~testfixtures.Comparison`
constructor. For this reason, you can pass the attributes in a
dictionary:

>>> compare(C(SomeClass,{'strict':3},strict=False),SomeClass(1,2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
  <C(failed):__builtin__.SomeClass>
  strict:3 not in other
  </C> != <__builtin__.SomeClass instance at ...>

Gotchas
~~~~~~~

There are a few things to be careful of when using comparisons:

.. work around Manuel bug :-(
.. invisible-code-block: python

  class NoVars(object):
      __slots__ = ['x']

- The default strict comparison cannot be used with a class such as
  the following:

  .. code-block:: python

    class NoVars(object):
         __slots__ = ['x']

  If you try, you will get an error that explains the problem:

  >>> C(NoVars,x=1)==NoVars()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
  TypeError: <NoVars object at ...> does not support vars() so cannot do strict comparison

  Comparisons can still be done with classes that don't support
  ``vars()``, they just need to be non-strict:

  >>> nv = NoVars()
  >>> nv.x = 1
  >>> C(NoVars,x=1,strict=False)==nv
  True
  
.. work around Manuel bug :-(
.. invisible-code-block: python
        class SomeModel:
            def __eq__(self,other):
                if isinstance(other,SomeModel):
                    return True
                return False

- If the object being compared has an ``__eq__`` method, such as
  Django model instances, then the :class:`~testfixtures.Comparison`
  must be the first object in the equality check.

  The following class is an example of this:

  .. code-block:: python

        class SomeModel:
            def __eq__(self,other):
                if isinstance(other,SomeModel):
                    return True
                return False
  
  It will not work correctly if used as the second object in the
  expression:

  >>> SomeModel()==C(SomeModel)
  False

  However, if the comparison is correctly placed first, then
  everything will behave as expected:

  >>> C(SomeModel)==SomeModel()
  True

- It probably goes without saying, but comparisons should not be used
  on both sides of an equality check:

  >>> C(SomeClass)==C(SomeClass)
  False

String Comparison objects
-------------------------

When comparing sequences of strings, particularly those comping from
things like the python logging package, you often end up wanting to
express a requirement that one string should be almost like another,
or maybe fit a particular regular expression.

For these situations, you can use :class:`StringComparison` objects
wherever you would use normal strings, and they will compare equal to
any string that matches the regular expression they are created with.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

  from testfixtures import compare, StringComparison as S

  compare(S('Starting thread \d+'),'Starting thread 132356')

Differentiating chunks of text
------------------------------

TextFixtures provides a function that will compare two strings and
give a unified diff as a result. This can be handy as a third
parameter to :meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual` or just as a
general utility function for comparing two lumps of text.

As an example:

>>> from testfixtures import diff
>>> print diff('line1\nline2\nline3',
...            'line1\nlineA\nline3')
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 line1
-line2
+lineA
 line3
