Comparing objects and sequences
===============================

.. currentmodule:: testfixtures

Python's :mod:`unittest` package often fails to give very useful
feedback when comparing long sequences or chunks of text. It also has
trouble dealing with objects that don't natively support
comparison. The functions and classes described here alleviate these
problems.

The compare function
--------------------

This function can be used as a replacement for
:meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual`. It raises an
``AssertionError`` when its parameters are not equal, which will be
reported as a test failure:

>>> from testfixtures import compare
>>> compare(1,2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 1 != 2

The real strengths of this function come when comparing more complex
data types.

Multi-line strings give unified diffs when their
comparison fails:

>>> compare("""
...         This is line 1
...         This is line 2
...         This is line 3
...         """,
...         """
...         This is line 1
...         This is another line
...         This is line 3
...         """)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
<BLANKLINE>
         This is line 1
-        This is line 2
+        This is another line
         This is line 3
<BLANKLINE>

Comparing sequences that aren't the same will attempt to highlight
where the differences lie:

>>> compare([1,2,3],[1,2,4])
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: Sequence not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
same:
[1, 2]
<BLANKLINE>
first:
[3]
<BLANKLINE>
second:
[4]

You can also use the :ref:`generator <generator>` helper to get
similar feedback about the results of iterating over a generator:

>>> from testfixtures import generator
>>> def my_gen(t):
...     i = 0
...     while i<t:
...         i += 1
...         yield i
>>> compare(my_gen(2),generator(1,2,3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: Sequence not as expected:
<BLANKLINE>
same:
(1, 2)
<BLANKLINE>
first:
()
<BLANKLINE>
second:
(3,)

The :meth:`~testfixtures.compare` function can also be used to replace
the the ``failUnless(x() is True)`` pattern: 

>>> compare(1 and 1,False)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 1 != False

If, for any reason, you need to check what is returned by
:meth:`~testfixtures.compare`, it will either raise an exception, or
return the ``identity`` singleton:

>>> from testfixtures import identity
>>> result = compare(1 and 1,True)
>>> result is identity
True

Comparing multi-line strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparison of multi-line strings can be painful, especially when small
differences occur that you don't actually care about but which cause
tests to fail. To help with this, :func:`compare` has two options that
can be set to ignore certain types of whitespace.

If you wish to compare two strings that contain blank lines or lines
containing only whitespace characters, but where you only care about
the content, you can use the following:

.. code-block:: python

  compare('line1\nline2','line1\n \nline2\n\n',
          blanklines=False)

If you wish to compare two strings made up of lines that may have
trailing whitespace that you don't care about, you can do so with the
following: 

.. code-block:: python

  compare('line1\nline2','line1 \t\nline2   \n',
          trailing_whitespace=False)

Comparison objects
------------------

Another common problem with the checking in tests is that not all
objects support comparison and nor should they need to. For this
reason, TextFixtures provides the :class:`~testfixtures.Comparison`
class.

This class lets you instantiate placeholders that can be used to
compared expected results with actual results where objects in the
actual results do not support useful comparison.  

Comparisons will appear to be equal to any object they are compared
with that matches their specification. For example, take the following
class: 

.. code-block:: python

  class SomeClass:

      def __init__(self,x,y):
         self.x,self.y = x,y

Normal comparison doesn't work, which makes testing tricky:

>>> SomeClass(1,2)==SomeClass(1,2)
False

Here's how this comparison can be done:

>>> from testfixtures import Comparison as C
>>> C(SomeClass,x=1,y=2)==SomeClass(1,2)
True

Perhaps even more importantly, when a comparison fails, its
representation changes to give information about what went wrong. The
common idiom for using comparisons is in conjuction with
:meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual` or
:meth:`~testfixtures.compare`: 

>>> compare(C(SomeClass,x=2),SomeClass(1,2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
  <C(failed):__builtin__.SomeClass>
  x:2 != 1
  y:2 not in Comparison
  </C> != <__builtin__.SomeClass instance at ...>

The key is that the comparison object actually stores information
about what it was last compared with. The following example shows this
more clearly: 

>>> c = C(SomeClass,x=2)
>>> print repr(c)
<BLANKLINE>
  <C:__builtin__.SomeClass>
  x:2
  </C>
>>> c == SomeClass(1,2)
False
>>> print repr(c)
<BLANKLINE>
  <C(failed):__builtin__.SomeClass>
  x:2 != 1
  y:2 not in Comparison
  </C>


Types of comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways a comparison can be set up depending on what
you want to check.

If you only care about the class of an object, you can set up the
comparison with only the class:

>>> C(SomeClass)==SomeClass(1,2)
True

This can also be achieved by specifying the type of the object as a
dotted name:

>>> import sys
>>> C('types.ModuleType')==sys
True

Alternatively, if you happen to have a non-comparable object already
around, comparison can be done with it:

>>> C(SomeClass(1,2))==SomeClass(1,2)
True

If you only care about certain attributes, this can also easily be
achieved with the `strict` parameter: 

>>> C(SomeClass,x=1,strict=False)==SomeClass(1,2)
True

The above can be problematic if you want to compare an object with
attibutes that share names with parameters to the :class:`~testfixtures.Comparison`
constructor. For this reason, you can pass the attributes in a
dictionary:

>>> compare(C(SomeClass,{'strict':3},strict=False),SomeClass(1,2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AssertionError: 
  <C(failed):__builtin__.SomeClass>
  strict:3 not in other
  </C> != <__builtin__.SomeClass instance at ...>

Gotchas
~~~~~~~

There are a few things to be careful of when using comparisons:

.. work around Manuel bug :-(
.. invisible-code-block: python

  class NoVars(object):
      __slots__ = ['x']

- The default strict comparison cannot be used with a class such as
  the following:

  .. code-block:: python

    class NoVars(object):
         __slots__ = ['x']

  If you try, you will get an error that explains the problem:

  >>> C(NoVars,x=1)==NoVars()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
  TypeError: <NoVars object at ...> does not support vars() so cannot do strict comparison

  Comparisons can still be done with classes that don't support
  ``vars()``, they just need to be non-strict:

  >>> nv = NoVars()
  >>> nv.x = 1
  >>> C(NoVars,x=1,strict=False)==nv
  True
  
.. work around Manuel bug :-(
.. invisible-code-block: python
        class SomeModel:
            def __eq__(self,other):
                if isinstance(other,SomeModel):
                    return True
                return False

- If the object being compared has an ``__eq__`` method, such as
  Django model instances, then the :class:`~testfixtures.Comparison`
  must be the first object in the equality check.

  The following class is an example of this:

  .. code-block:: python

        class SomeModel:
            def __eq__(self,other):
                if isinstance(other,SomeModel):
                    return True
                return False
  
  It will not work correctly if used as the second object in the
  expression:

  >>> SomeModel()==C(SomeModel)
  False

  However, if the comparison is correctly placed first, then
  everything will behave as expected:

  >>> C(SomeModel)==SomeModel()
  True

- It probably goes without saying, but comparisons should not be used
  on both sides of an equality check:

  >>> C(SomeClass)==C(SomeClass)
  False

String Comparison objects
-------------------------

When comparing sequences of strings, particularly those comping from
things like the python logging package, you often end up wanting to
express a requirement that one string should be almost like another,
or maybe fit a particular regular expression.

For these situations, you can use :class:`StringComparison` objects
wherever you would use normal strings, and they will compare equal to
any string that matches the regular expression they are created with.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

  from testfixtures import compare, StringComparison as S

  compare(S('Starting thread \d+'),'Starting thread 132356')

Differentiating chunks of text
------------------------------

TextFixtures provides a function that will compare two strings and
give a unified diff as a result. This can be handy as a third
parameter to :meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual` or just as a
general utility function for comparing two lumps of text.

As an example:

>>> from testfixtures import diff
>>> print diff('line1\nline2\nline3',
...            'line1\nlineA\nline3')
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 line1
-line2
+lineA
 line3
