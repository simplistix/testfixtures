Mocking out objects and methods
===============================

Mocking is the process of replacing chunks of complex functionality
that aren't the subject of the test with mock objects that allow you
to check that the mocked out functionality is being used as expected. 

In this way, you can break down testing of a complicated set of
interacting components into testing of each individual component.
The behaviour of components can then be tested individually, 
irrespective of the behaviour of the components around it.

There are many implementations of mock objects in the python world. An
excellent example and the one recommended for use with TestFixtures is
the Mock package: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock/

Methods of replacement
----------------------

TestFixtures provides three different methods of mocking out
functionality that can be used to replace functions, classes
or even individual methods on a class. Consider the following module:

.. topic:: testfixtures.tests.sample1
   :class: module

   .. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/sample1.py
      :pyobject: X

.. do the import quietly

  >>> from testfixtures.tests.sample1 import X

We want to mock out the ``y`` method of the ``X`` class, with,
for example, the following function: 

.. code-block:: python

  def mock_y(self):
       return 'mock y'

The context manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using a version of Python where the ``with`` keyword is
available, the context manager provided by TestFixtures can be used:

.. code-block:: python

  from testfixtures import Replacer
  
  def test_function():
      with Replacer() as r:
          r.replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.y',mock_y)
          print X().y()

For the duration of the ``with`` block, the replacement is used:

>>> test_function()
mock y

The decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are working in a traditional :mod:`unittest` environment and
want to replace different things in different test functions, you may
find the decorator suits your needs better:

.. code-block:: python

  from testfixtures import replace
  
  @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.y',mock_y)
  def test_function():
      print X().y()

When using the decorator, the replacement is used for the duration of
the decorated callable's execution:

>>> test_function()
mock y

If you need to manipulate or inspect the object that's used as a
replacement, you can add an extra parameter to your function. The
decorator will see this and pass the replacement in it's place:

.. code-block:: python

  from mock import Mock
  from testfixtures import compare,replace
  
  @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.y',Mock())
  def test_function(m):
      m.return_value = 'mock y'
      print X().y()
      compare(m.call_args_list,[((), {})])

The above still results in the same output:

>>> test_function()
mock y

Manual usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to replace something for the duration of a doctest or you
want to replace something for every test in a
:class:`~unittest.TestCase`, then you can use the
:class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` manually.

The instantiation and replacement are done in the ``setUp`` function
of the :class:`~unittest.TestCase` or passed to the
:class:`~doctest.DocTestSuite` constructor:

>>> from testfixtures import Replacer
>>> r = Replacer()
>>> r.replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.y',mock_y)

The replacement then stays in place until removed:

>>> X().y()
'mock y'

Then, in the ``tearDown`` function
of the :class:`~unittest.TestCase` or passed to the
:class:`~doctest.DocTestSuite` constructor, the replacement is
removed:

>>> r.restore()
>>> X().y()
'original y'

Replacing more than one thing
-----------------------------

Both the :class:`~testfixtures.Replacer` and the
:func:`~testfixtures.replace` decorator can be used to replace more
than one thing at a time. For the former, this is fairly obvious:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_function():
      with Replacer() as r:
          r.replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.y',Mock())
          r.replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.aMethod',Mock())
          x = X()
          print x.y(),x.aMethod()

.. the result:
  
   >>> test_function()
   <mock.Mock object at ...> <mock.Mock object at ...>

For the decorator, it's less obvious but still pretty easy:

.. code-block:: python

  @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.y',Mock())
  @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.X.aMethod',Mock())
  def test_function(mock_aMethod, mock_y):
      x = X()
      print x.y(),x.aMethod()

.. the result:
  
   >>> test_function()
   <mock.Mock object at ...> <mock.Mock object at ...>

You'll notice that you can still get access to the replacements, even
though there are more than one of them.

Replacing things that may not be there
--------------------------------------

The following code shows a situation where ``hpy`` may or may not be
present depending on whether the ``guppy`` package is installed or
not. 


.. topic:: testfixtures.tests.sample2
   :class: module

   .. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/sample2.py
      :lines: 11-19

To test the behaviour of the code that uses ``hpy`` in both of
these cases, regardless of whether or not the ``guppy`` package is
actually installed, we need to be able to mock out both ``hpy`` and the
``guppy`` global. This is done by doing non-strict replacement, as
shown in the following :class:`~unittest.TestCase`:

.. imports

  >>> import unittest,sys
  >>> from cStringIO import StringIO

.. code-block:: python

    from testfixtures.tests.sample2 import dump

    class Tests(unittest.TestCase):

        @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample2.guppy',True)
        @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample2.hpy',Mock(),strict=False)
        def test_method(self,hpy):

            dump('somepath')

            compare(hpy.call_args_list,[((),{})])
            hpy_i = hpy.return_value
            compare(hpy_i.method_calls,[('heap',(),{})])
            h = hpy_i.heap.return_value
            compare(h.method_calls,[('stat.dump', ('somepath',),{})])

        @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample2.guppy',False)
        @replace('testfixtures.tests.sample2.hpy',Mock(),strict=False)
        def test_method_no_heapy(self,hpy):

            dump('somepath')

            compare(hpy.call_args_list,[])

.. the result:
  
   >>> suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(Tests)
   >>> unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=0,stream=StringIO()).run(suite)
   <unittest._TextTestResult run=2 errors=0 failures=0>


The :meth:`~testfixtures.Replacer.replace` method also supports
non-strict replacement using the same keyword parameter.

Gotchas
-------

- Make sure you replace the object where it's used and not where it's
  defined. For example, with the following code from the
  ``testfixtures.tests.sample1`` package:

  .. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/sample1.py
     :lines: 26-28

  You might be tempted to mock things as follows:

  >>> r = Replacer()
  >>> r.replace('time.time',Mock())
  
  But this won't work:

  >>> from testfixtures.tests.sample1 import str_time
  >>> type(float(str_time()))
  <type 'float'>

  You need to replace :func:`~time.time` where it's used, not where
  it's defined:

  >>> r.replace('testfixtures.tests.sample1.time',Mock())
  >>> str_time()
  '<mock.Mock object at ...>'

  .. cleanup  
 
    >>> r.restore()

  A corollary of this is that you need to replace *all* occurrences of
  an original to safely be able to test. This can be tricky when an
  original is imported into many modules that may be used by a
  particular test.
  
- You can't replace whole top level modules, and nor should you want
  to! The reason being that everything up to the last dot in the
  replacement target specifies where the replacement will take place,
  and the part after the last dot is used as the name of the thing to
  be replaced:

  >>> Replacer().replace('sys',Mock())
  Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
  ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
