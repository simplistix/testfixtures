Testing use of the subprocess package
=====================================

When using the :mod:`subprocess` package there are two approaches to testing:

* Have your tests exercise the real processes being instantiated and used.

* Mock out use of the :mod:`subprocess` package and provide expected output
  while recording interactions with the package to make sure they are as
  expected.

While the first of these should be preferred, it means that you need to have all
the external software available everywhere you wish to run tests. Your tests
will also need to make sure any dependencies of that software on
an external environment are met. If that external software takes a long time to
run, your tests will also take a long time to run.

These challenges can often make the second approach more practical and can
be the more pragmatic approach when coupled with a mock that accurately
simulates the behaviour of a subprocess. :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`
is an attempt to provide just such a mock.

.. note:: To use :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`, you must have the
          :mod:`mock` package installed or be using Python 3.3 or later.

.. warning::
   Previous versions of this mock made use of :attr:`~unittest.mock.Mock.mock_calls`.
   These are deceptively incapable of recording some information important in the use
   of this mock, so please switch to making assertions about
   :attr:`~MockPopen.all_calls` and :attr:`~MockPopenInstance.calls` instead.

Example usage
-------------

As an example, suppose you have code such as the following that you need to
test:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :lines: 4-12

Tests that exercise this code using :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`
could be written as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :lines: 16-52


Passing input to processes
--------------------------

If your testing requires passing input to the subprocess, you can do so by
checking for the input passed to :meth:`~subprocess.Popen.communicate` method
when you check the calls on the mock as shown in this example:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_communicate_with_input
   :dedent: 4

.. note:: Accessing ``.stdin`` isn't current supported by this mock.


Reading from ``stdout`` and ``stderr``
--------------------------------------

The :attr:`~MockPopenInstance.stdout` and :attr:`~MockPopenInstance.stderr`
attributes of the mock returned by
:class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` will be file-like objects as with
the real :class:`~subprocess.Popen` and can be read as shown in this example:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_read_from_stdout_and_stderr
   :dedent: 4

.. warning::

    While these streams behave a lot like the streams of a real
    :class:`~subprocess.Popen` object, they do not exhibit the deadlocking
    behaviour that can occur when the two streams are read as in the example
    above. Be very careful when reading :attr:`~MockPopenInstance.stdout` and
    :attr:`~MockPopenInstance.stderr` and
    consider using :meth:`~subprocess.Popen.communicate` instead.


Writing to ``stdin``
--------------------
If you set ``stdin=PIPE`` in your call to :class:`~subprocess.Popen` then the
:attr:`~MockPopenInstance.stdin`
attribute of the mock returned by :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`
will be a mock and you can then examine the write calls to it as shown
in this example:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_write_to_stdin
   :dedent: 4


Specifying the return code
--------------------------

Often code will need to behave differently depending on the return code of the
launched process. Specifying a simulated response code, along with testing for
the correct usage of :meth:`~subprocess.Popen.wait`, can be seen in the
following example:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_wait_and_return_code
   :dedent: 4

Checking for signal sending
---------------------------

Calls to :meth:`~MockPopenInstance.send_signal`,
:meth:`MockPopenInstance.terminate` and :meth:`MockPopenInstance.kill` are all
recorded by the mock returned by :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen`
but otherwise do nothing as shown in the following example, which doesn't
make sense for a real test of sub-process usage but does show how the mock
behaves:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_send_signal
   :dedent: 4

Polling a process
-----------------

The :meth:`~subprocess.Popen.poll` method is often used as part of a loop
in order to do other work while waiting for a sub-process to complete.
The mock returned by :class:`~testfixtures.popen.MockPopen` supports this
by allowing the :meth:`~MockPopenInstance.poll` method to
be called a number of times before
the :attr:`~MockPopenInstance.returncode` is set using the
``poll_count`` parameter as shown in
the following example:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_poll_until_result
   :dedent: 4

Different behaviour on sequential processes
-------------------------------------------

If your code needs to call the same command but have different behaviour
on each call, then you can pass a callable behaviour like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_multiple_responses
   :dedent: 4

If you need to keep state across calls, such as accumulating
:attr:`~MockPopenInstance.stdin` or
failing for a configurable number of calls, then wrap that behaviour up
into a class:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: CustomBehaviour

This can then be used like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_count_down
   :dedent: 4


Using default behaviour
-----------------------

If you're testing something that needs to make many calls to many different
commands that all behave the same, it can be tedious to specify the behaviour
of each with :class:`~MockPopen.set_command`. For this case, :class:`~MockPopen`
has the :class:`~MockPopen.set_default` method which can be used to set the
behaviour of any command that has not been specified with
:class:`~MockPopen.set_command` as shown in the
following example:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_default_behaviour
   :dedent: 4


Tracking multiple simultaneous processes
----------------------------------------

Conversely, if you're testing something that spins up multiple subprocesses
and manages their simultaneous execution, you will want to explicitly define the
behaviour of each process using :class:`~MockPopen.set_command` and then make
assertions about each process using :attr:`~MockPopen.all_calls`.

For example, suppose we wanted to test this function:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: process_in_batches

Then you could test it as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../testfixtures/tests/test_popen_docs.py
   :pyobject: TestMyFunc.test_multiple_processes
   :dedent: 4

Note that the order of all calls is explicitly recorded. If the order of these calls
is non-deterministic due to your method of process management, you will need to
do more work and be very careful when testing.
