=======================
Using Buildout Versions
=======================

A minimal example would be to have a :file:`buildout.cfg` as follows::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  parts =

.. -> buildout_cfg

Since no versions have been pinned in a versions section, when the
buildout is run the output would indicate those versions that were
picked::

  $ bin/buildout
  Versions had to be automatically picked.
  The following part definition lists the versions picked:
  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

That output can be used to update the :file:`buildout.cfg`::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  versions = versions
  parts =

  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0

.. -> buildout_cfg

Now, when the buildout is run, there will be no output::

  $ bin/buildout

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

Pinning the Python version
--------------------------

If you want to make sure that a buildout is only run with a specific
version of python, then you can specify this in the versions section::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  versions = versions
  parts =

  [versions]
  python = 2.6
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0

.. -> buildout_cfg

.. invisible-code-block: python

  import sys
  run_buildout(buildout_cfg.replace('2.6', sys.version.split()[0]),expected)

This check is a substring check of the value specified, so you can be
as specific as you want. If you need a bug fix that appeared in Python
2.6.2, you could specify `python` as ``2.6.1``. If you need
Enthought's python distribution, you could specify `python` as ``EPD 7.1-2``.

The following :file:`buildout.cfg` contains a python version that
doesn't match the python used to run the buildout::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  versions = versions
  parts =

  [versions]
  python = 1.0
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0

.. -> buildout_cfg

When this file is used, buildout will fail with an error::

  $ bin/buildout
  While:
    Installing.
    Loading extensions.
  Error: python version specified not found in sys.version: 1.0

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg, expected)


Development packages
--------------------

Packages being developed will never be considered as unpinned. 
Take the following :file:`buildout.cfg` as an example::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  develop = sample_package
  parts =

.. -> buildout_cfg

When the buildout is run, :mod:`sample_package` will not be
reported::

  $ bin/buildout
  Develop: '.../sample_package'
  Versions had to be automatically picked.
  The following part definition lists the versions picked:
  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

Dependent packages
------------------

A :file:`buildout.cfg` may specify a :mod:`package-a` and pin
it's version, as in the following example::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  find-links = <our index>
  parts = sample
  versions = versions
  
  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  package-a = 1.0
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0
  zc.recipe.egg = 1.2.0

  [sample]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = package-a

.. -> buildout_cfg

However, :mod:`package-a` may depend on :mod:`package-b`, which isn't
pinned. When run, Buildout Versions will point this out and give an
explanation of what package depends on it::

  $ bin/buildout
  Installing sample.
  Getting distribution for 'package-a==1.0'.
  Got package-a 1.0.
  Getting distribution for 'package-b'.
  Got package-b 2.0.
  Versions had to be automatically picked.
  The following part definition lists the versions picked:
  [versions]

  # Required by:
  # package-a==1.0
  package-b = 2.0

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

Version specification files
---------------------------

It can be convenient to separate out the pinned versions into their
own file. Buildout Versions supports this by allowing a file to
which version information will be written to be specified in the
`buildout_versions_file` option of the `[buildout]` section::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  buildout_versions_file = versions.cfg
  find-links = <our index>
  parts = sample

  [sample]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = package-a

.. -> buildout_cfg

When the above buildout is run, output is still written to the
console::

  $ bin/buildout
  Installing sample.
  Versions had to be automatically picked.
  The following part definition lists the versions picked:
  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  package-a = 1.0
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0b2
  zc.recipe.egg = 1.2.3b2

  # Required by:
  # package-a==1.0
  package-b = 2.0
  This information has been written to 'versions.cfg'

.. -> expected

However, the details of packages that weren't pinned will also be
written to :file:`versions.cfg`, which will contain:: 

  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  package-a = 1.0
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0b2
  zc.recipe.egg = 1.2.3b2

  # Required by:
  # package-a==1.0
  package-b = 2.0

.. -> expected_versions_cfg

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

  from testfixtures import compare
  compare(fix_buildout(expected_versions_cfg),
          fix_buildout(buildout_dir.read('versions.cfg')))

The resulting :file:`versions.cfg` can then be used in the buildout as
follows::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout-versions
  buildout_versions_file = versions.cfg
  extends = versions.cfg
  versions = versions
  find-links = <our index>
  parts = sample

  [sample]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = package-a

.. -> buildout_cfg

Since all the package versions are pinned, running this buildout will
result in no output::

  $ bin/buildout
  Installing sample.

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

A common way of working is to have multiple files containing version
specifications layered on top of each other. For example, the
:file:`versions.cfg` above might look like::

  [buildout]
  extends = base_versions.cfg

  [versions]
  package-a = 1.0

.. -> versions_cfg

The example doesn't pin :mod:`package-a`, so when the buildout is run,
there will be output::

  $ bin/buildout
  Installing sample.
  Versions had to be automatically picked.
  The following part definition lists the versions picked:
  [versions]

  # Required by:
  # package-a==1.0
  package-b = 2.0
  This information has been written to 'versions.cfg'

.. -> expected

Buildout Versions will also append the missing version to
:file:`versions.cfg`, resulting in it containing the following::
  
  [buildout]
  extends = base_versions.cfg

  [versions]
  package-a = 1.0

  # Added by Buildout Versions at 2010-07-30 15:44:45.023559

  # Required by:
  # package-a==1.0
  package-b = 2.0

.. -> expected_versions_cfg

.. invisible-code-block: python

  buildout_dir.write('base_versions.cfg',fix_buildout('''
  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0b2
  zc.recipe.egg = 1.2.3b2
  '''))
  buildout_dir.write('versions.cfg',versions_cfg)

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

  from testfixtures import compare
  compare(expected_versions_cfg,fix_buildout(buildout_dir.read('versions.cfg')))

Distribution capitalisation
---------------------------

Setuptools, which Buildout uses for its package management, is
agnostic to the capitalisation of distributions. Buildout, however, is
case sensitive when it pins versions. Buildout Versions fixes this
problem.

For example, if :mod:`PackageC` depends on :mod:`PackageD`, but
expresses this dependency as :mod:`packaged`, Buildout would normally
ignore any version pins specified for PackageD, even though a version
fo PackageD would be successfully installed.

So, with a :file:`buildout.cfg` as follows::

  [buildout]
  find-links = <our index>
  parts = sample
  versions = versions
  
  [versions]
  PackageC = 3.0
  PackageD = 4.0

  [sample]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = PackageC

.. -> buildout_cfg

Buildout will pick the wrong version of PackageD::

  $ bin/buildout
  Installing sample.
  Getting distribution for 'PackageC==3.0'.
  Got PackageC 3.0.
  Getting distribution for 'packaged'.
  Got PackageD 5.0.

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)

The :file:`buildout.cfg` should be changed to use Buildout Versions as
follows::

  [buildout]
  extensions = buildout_versions
  find-links = <our index>
  parts = sample
  versions = versions
  
  [versions]
  buildout-versions = 1.2
  setuptools = 0.6c11
  zc.buildout = 1.5.0
  zc.recipe.egg = 1.2.0

  PackageC = 3.0
  PackageD = 4.0

  [sample]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = PackageC

.. -> buildout_cfg

Now, the correct version of PackageD will be used::

  $ bin/buildout
  Installing sample.
  Getting distribution for 'packaged==4.0'.
  Got PackageD 4.0.

.. -> expected

.. invisible-code-block: python

  run_buildout(buildout_cfg,expected)
