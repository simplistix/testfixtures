Buildout Versions
=================

This is a buildout extension that provides two functions:

- Output to the console of any versions not pinned in the buildout configuration

- The optional appending of any versions not pinned in the buildout configuration to a specified file.

For full documentation, please see http://packages.python.org/buildout_versions.

This package takes a lot of inspiration from `buildout.dumppickedversions`.
